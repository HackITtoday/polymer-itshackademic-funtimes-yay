# Polymer Starter Project (Hacked about inexpertly by Andy Mantell and Marcus Hitchins)
Extending the polymer start project to include a map of users. Click the pins on each user to show them on the map. Somehow (magically) achieved via 2-way data binding between the post-list and the post-map elements.
May make some sense to attendees of the hack day.
May not.

## How to use
First install node.js, bower, grunt-cli (See http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
On a command line:
* `npm install` (grunt depdendencies)
* `bower install` (polymer dependencies)
* `grunt serve` (start the web server)
* visit `localhost:3000` in your browser
