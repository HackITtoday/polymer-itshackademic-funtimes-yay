# Polymer Starter Project (Hacked about inexpertly by Andy Mantell and Marcus Hitchins)
Extending the polymer start project to include a map of users. Click the pins on each user to show them on the map. Somehow (magically) achieved via 2-way data binding between the post-list and the post-map elements.
May make some sense to attendees of the hack day.
May not.
